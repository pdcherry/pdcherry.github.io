Yet, many **r**epublican ideals and beliefs do receive substantial support from locals.\n\nThis dynamic causes practically republican organizations to outwardly re-code and re-brand as something—anything—other than GOP. Popular self-descriptions include Moderate or middle-of-the-road Democrat. However, this analysis is motivated by ignoring these pretenses and looking exclusively at indicated issue recommendations / endorsements, and understanding how similar vs. how different each political organization is acting (a behaviorist / empirical approach).\n\n## Notes on approach\nThe website [sfendorsements.com](https://sfendorsements.com/) has collected and cataloged many of the city's politically active groups' (often Political Action Committees, or PACs) positions on ballot measures and election races for local positions. I hypothesize that these can be used to deduce the true alignment of these organizations.\n\nPeter Xu [make the code available](https://gitlab.com/peterxu/sf-endorsements), and has has previously made [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3cGgXjI912nA8e1_iTlEhJ7XpxjpSKZdT7wX3ryztg/edit#gid=1545354255) available for the endorsement data, but those are for 2022.\n\nFor this analysis, I will scrape the 2024 data, tidy it up, and analyze it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Import and tidy data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<!-- ```{r, message = FALSE} -->\n<!-- former_endorsements_import <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss = \"1f3cGgXjI912nA8e1_iTlEhJ7XpxjpSKZdT7wX3ryztg\", -->\n<!--                                                  sheet = \"Endorsements\", -->\n<!--                                                  col_types = \"c\") %>% -->\n<!--   select(!Instructions) -->\n\n<!-- endorsements_tidy <- endorsements_import %>% -->\n<!--   pivot_longer(cols = !1, names_to = \"names\") %>% -->\n<!--   pivot_wider(id_cols = names, names_from = 1) %>% -->\n<!--   type_convert() -->\n\n<!-- slice_head(endorsements_import, n = 5) %>% select(1:3, 5) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nGreat, the data are now tidy, where each row is an observation (a political group), and each column is a variable (race / measure).\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the propositions?\n\n::: {#tbl-props .cell tbl-cap='Table of proposition names, titles, and descriptive summary'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Prop </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Title </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/\" style=\"     \" >Prop 1</a> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mental health care reform including bond measure to fund treatment beds </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposition 1 would shift the way California spends tax revenue from the Mental Health Services Act to cover addiction treatment and housing.

The SF Chronicle has posted some endorsements on Ballot Measures E and F that were not included in this analysis. Thanks to Scott for noticing this. As of this moment, I have manually verified and added these to the table.\n:::\n\n\n## Analyze organizations by ballot measures\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Who is recommending what?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_03_02-SF_political_support_data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVisually, we can see from this plot that there is significant variation across political organizations on endorsements for props C, E, F, G, and to a lesser extent B; whereas ballot measures 1, A, and D show less variation among political organizations. Also, interestingly, some organizations that offer endorsements did not endorse any position for some (or even most) propositions on the March 5 ballot.\n\nHowever, for the above plot, the variation is easier to see than if the political organizations were sorted alphabetically because I cheated: I pre-sorted these based on their clustering order. So let's explore the clustering result.\n\n### Nominal clustering\nClustering is typically a quantitative method, so special accommodations have to be taken for clustering nominal / factor data like these (where there are discrete values that do not have an order over one another). Luckily, we can use the [`nomclust`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomclust/index.html) package ([paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-022-01209-4)), which handles the details as a purpose-built package for hierarchical clustering of nominal (categorical) variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_03_02-SF_political_support_data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe underlying data have been updated since the original publication. The clustering is meaningfully different than previously displayed.\n:::\n\nGenerally speaking, the agglomerative coefficient of a clustering analysis describes the strength of the clustering structure that has been obtained by group average linkage. The coefficient takes values from 0 to 1, and is calculated as the mean of the normalized lengths at which the clusters are formed, _e.g._ the uniformity lengths displayed on the dendrogram. The more evenly and gradually the categories get broken down into different clusters, the closer to 1 the agglomerative coefficient will be.\n\nVery tellingly, we see three broad clusters:\n\n - On the left (in red), the fist cluster is the largest cluster (in terms of number of organizations). It contains some heavy hitters, like the San Francisco Chronicle, the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club, and the San Francisco Democratic Party.  \n - Next, in the middle (in green), this cluster is defined by SPUR and the YIMBY Action / Sierra Club / SF League of Conservation Voters (the latter three having identical ballot measure endorsements).\n - On the right (in blue) is the cluster defined by the SF Republican Party. It also contains many low-distance neighborhood Democratic Clubs, and [GrowSF](https://growsf.org/), a nominally non-partisan and [well-funded](https://missionlocal.org/2024/02/explore-big-money-san-francisco-growsf-togethersf-neighbors-larsen-moritz-tan-web/) local 501(c)(4) political advocacy group.\n\n#### Political organization distance heat map\nI can also make a heat map of the clustering distance, or dissimilarity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_03_02-SF_political_support_data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe heat map shows darker, purple-er coloring for pairs of organizations whose set of endorsements are more similar, and lighter, yellow-er colors for organizations with very different endorsements.\n\n#### Political organization distance table\n\n:::

This result supports the idea that an empirical approach can reveal more about the character of an organization that the words in its name.\n",
