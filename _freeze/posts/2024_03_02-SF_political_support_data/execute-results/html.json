I hypothesize that these can be used to deduce the true alignment of these organizations.\n\nPeter Xu has been nice enough to [make the code available](https://gitlab.com/peterxu/sf-endorsements) for sfendorsements.com, and hosts the data in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3cGgXjI912nA8e1_iTlEhJ7XpxjpSKZdT7wX3ryztg/edit#gid=1545354255) that we can easily import for analysis.
