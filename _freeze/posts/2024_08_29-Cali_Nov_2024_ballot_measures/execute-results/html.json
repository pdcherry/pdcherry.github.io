This is less than other *very lengthy* ballots previously sent to voters [@sfvote1993], but still longer than many in recent memory.\n\nBelow, I have collated the ballot measure numbers (or letters), titles, descriptions, and some context (in some cases, where available.)\n\n## State-wide ballot measures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-state-props .cell tbl-cap='Table of statewide ballot propositions'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Title </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Name </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Type </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Notes </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposition 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Borrow $10 billion to build schools. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> BI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Issue $10 billion in bonds to fund construction and modernization of public education facilities </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Legislative Democrats put on the ballot a bond issue to give $8.5 billion to K-12 schools and $1.5 billion to community colleges for construction and modernization. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposition 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Reaffirm the right of same-sex couples to marry. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> LRCA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Repeal Proposition 8 and establish a right to marry </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> This constitutional amendment from the Legislature would remove outdated language from Proposition 8 passed by voters in 2008 that characterizes marriage as being between a man and a woman. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposition 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Borrow $10 billion for climate programs. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> BI </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Issue $10 billion in bonds to fund state and local parks, environmental protection projects, water infrastructure projects, energy projects, and flood protection projects </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Legislative Democrats also placed a bond issue on the ballot that includes $3.8 billion for drinking water and groundwater $1.5 billion for wildfire and forest programs and $1.2 billion for sea level rise.
