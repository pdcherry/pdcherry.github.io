Yet, many **r**epublican ideals and beliefs do receive substantial support from locals.\n\nThis dynamic causes practically republican organizations to outwardly re-code and re-brand as something—anything—other than GOP. Popular self-descriptions include Moderate or middle-of-the-road Democrat. However, this analysis is motivated by ignoring these pretenses and looking exclusively at indicated issue recommendations / endorsements, and understanding how similar vs. how different each political organization is acting (a behaviorist / empirical approach).\n\n## Notes on approach\nThe website [sfendorsements.com](https://sfendorsements.com/) has collected and cataloged many of the city's politically active groups' (often Political Action Committees, or PACs) positions on ballot measures and election races for local positions. I hypothesize that these can be used to deduce the true alignment of these organizations.\n\nPeter Xu [make the code available](https://gitlab.com/peterxu/sf-endorsements), and has has previously made [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3cGgXjI912nA8e1_iTlEhJ7XpxjpSKZdT7wX3ryztg/edit#gid=1545354255) available for the endorsement data, but those are for 2022.\n\nFor this analysis, I will scrape the November 2024 General Elections data, tidy it up, and analyze it.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nThis page may be incomplete. As of 2024-10-09, endorsement data has yet to be published for a few organizations that have made recommendations in the past (San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, United Educators of San Francisco, ~~SPUR (Planning / Urban Research Association)~~, Tech Workers Voter Guide, San Francisco Parent Action, San Francisco Rising Action, and SF Young Democrats).\n:::\n\n - SPUR published their voter guide 2024-10-08.\n - Yes on L [let me know](https://sfba.social/@sftransitact/113283728641463168) that Housing Action Coalition now endorses Prop L ((which is true)[https://housingactioncoalition.org/news/november-2024-election-endorsements/#section-sf], as of what date I'm not sure).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Import and tidy data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nGreat, the data are now tidy, where each row is an observation (a political group), and each column is a variable (race / measure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## What are the propositions?\nSee the [August 29 post on San Francisco’s November 2024 ballot review](2024_08_29-Cali_Nov_2024_ballot_measures.qmd#state-wide-ballot-measures) page for full descriptions of each State-wide and San Francisco ballot measure.\n\n## Analyze by ballot measures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Who is recommending what?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Color-coded layout of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of state and local ballot measures](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-measure-plot-1.png){#fig-measure-plot width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nVisually, we can see from this plot that there is significant variation across political organizations on endorsements for props 33, 36, C, D, E, and F and to a lesser extent 34, G, L, and N; whereas ballot measures 2, 3, 32, A, B, and O show less variation among political organizations. Also, interestingly, some organizations that offer endorsements did not endorse any position for some (or even most) propositions on the November 5 ballot.\n\nHowever, for the above plot, the variation is easier to see than if the political organizations were sorted alphabetically because I cheated: I pre-sorted these based on their clustering order. So let's explore the clustering result. I can plot the clustering dendrogram along side the endorsement color code data to illustrate:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Color-coded of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of state and local ballot measures with dendrogram displayed](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-measure-with-dendro-plot-1.png){#fig-measure-with-dendro-plot width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Nominal clustering\nClustering is typically a quantitative method, so special accommodations have to be taken for clustering nominal / factor data like these (where there are discrete values that do not have an order over one another). Luckily, we can use the [`nomclust`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomclust/index.html) package ([paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-022-01209-4)), which handles the details as a purpose-built package for hierarchical clustering of nominal (categorical) variables.\n\nOne weakness of this clustering analysis is that it weights all ballot measures and races as the same. For an individual voter, some topics and races may have more salience or effect, and this analysis cannot take that into account.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dendrogram of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of state and local ballot measures](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-measure-dendrogram-1.png){#fig-measure-dendrogram width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the agglomerative coefficient of a clustering analysis describes the strength of the clustering structure that has been obtained by group average linkage. The coefficient takes values from 0 to 1, and is calculated as the mean of the normalized lengths at which the clusters are formed, _e.g._ the uniformity lengths displayed on the dendrogram. The more evenly and gradually the categories get broken down into different clusters, the closer to 1 the agglomerative coefficient will be.\n\n#### Political organization distance heat map\nI can also make a heat map of the clustering distance, or dissimilarity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Heat map of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of state and local ballot measures](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-measure-dist-heatmap-1.png){#fig-measure-dist-heatmap width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe heat map shows darker, purple-er coloring for pairs of organizations whose set of endorsements are more similar, and lighter, yellow-er colors for organizations with very different endorsements.\n\n## Trying clustering again on just SF local ballot measure data\nAs the color-coded Yes / No / NA plot showed above (@fig-measure-plot), many organizations did not make endorsements in the state-wide ballot measures (which get coded for clustering purposes as \"No comment\"). This phenomenon may be skewing the clustering results, causing the result to over-index on the \"No comment\" ballot measures rather than the active \"Yes or No\" endorsements. Because these \"No comment\" observations appear overwhelmingly in the State measures, we can run clustering only on the SF local measures.\n\n### Analyze by SF-local-only ballot measures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dendrogram of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of local-only ballot measures](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-SF-measure-dendrogram-1.png){#fig-SF-measure-dendrogram width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis clustering (@fig-SF-measure-dendrogram) shows a different result than the first dendrogram (@fig-measure-dendrogram).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Color-coded layout of political organizations' Yes / No / no opinion endorsement of local-only sorting](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/fig-SF-measure-plot-1.png){#fig-SF-measure-plot width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nShown above (@fig-SF-measure-plot), we can generate the Yes / No map with ordering based on the clustering of only the SF measures.\n\nThe clustering and ordering by SF-ballot measures only shows that the \"no comment\" was having a disproportional effect on the clustering, and now those political organizations are getting distributed elsewhere among the clusters.\n\nCluster 1 (on the left in @fig-SF-measure-dendrogram and on the top in @fig-SF-measure-plot) now contains a mixture of Republican and Democratic organizations. Based on the alignment, \"No\" endorsements for Props C, E, G, N, and to a lesser extent L are key features of this cluster, and \"Yes\" endorsements for D, and F are also prominent.\n\nIn contrast, Cluster 2 (in the middle of the figures) features prominent \"No\" endorsement for D and F, and high levels of \"Yes\" support for C and E.\n\nCluster 3 is fairly dominated by the \"No comment\" non-endorsements among the SF local ballot measures, but feature prominent \"Yes\" support for B, G, K, and L, which contrasts with the varying support for both in clusters 1 and 2. This makes some sense due to the non-partisan interests of measure K (Permanently Closing the Upper Great Highway to Private Vehicles to Establish a Public) and L (Additional Business Tax on Transportation Network Companies and Autonomous Vehicle Businesses to Fund Public Transportation).\n\n#### Political organization distance table\n\n\n::: {#tbl-org-dis .cell tbl-cap='Table of unique political organization pairs, sorted by clustering proximity'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-362652ec6ea18a847966\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-362652ec6ea18a847966\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"extensions\":[\"FixedColumns\",\"FixedHeader\"],\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\",\"45\",\"46\",\"47\",\"48\",\"49\",\"50\",\"51\",\"52\",\"53\",\"54\",\"55\",\"56\",\"57\",\"58\",\"59\",\"60\",\"61\",\"62\",\"63\",\"64\",\"65\",\"66\",\"67\",\"68\",\"69\",\"70\",\"71\",\"72\",\"73\",\"74\",\"75\",\"76\",\"77\",\"78\",\"79\",\"80\",\"81\",\"82\",\"83\",\"84\",\"85\",\"86\",\"87\",\"88\",\"89\",\"90\",\"91\",\"92\",\"93\",\"94\",\"95\",\"96\",\"97\",\"98\",\"99\",\"100\",\"101\",\"102\",\"103\",\"104\",\"105\",\"106\",\"107\",\"108\",\"109\",\"110\",\"111\",\"112\",\"113\",\"114\",\"115\",\"116\",\"117\",\"118\",\"119\",\"120\",\"121\",\"122\",\"123\",\"124\",\"125\",\"126\",\"127\",\"128\",\"129\",\"130\",\"131\",\"132\",\"133\",\"134\",\"135\",\"136\",\"137\",\"138\",\"139\",\"140\",\"141\",\"142\",\"143\",\"144\",\"145\",\"146\",\"147\",\"148\",\"149\",\"150\",\"151\",\"152\",\"153\",\"154\",\"155\",\"156\",\"157\",\"158\",\"159\",\"160\",\"161\",\"162\",\"163\",\"164\",\"165\",\"166\",\"167\",\"168\",\"169\",\"170\",\"171\",\"172\",\"173\",\"174\",\"175\",\"176\",\"177\",\"178\",\"179\",\"180\",\"181\",\"182\",\"183\",\"184\",\"185\",\"186\",\"187\",\"188\",\"189\",\"190\",\"191\",\"192\",\"193\",\"194\",\"195\",\"196\",\"197\",\"198\",\"199\",\"200\",\"201\",\"202\",\"203\",\"204\",\"205\",\"206\",\"207\",\"208\",\"209\",\"210\",\"211\",\"212\",\"213\",\"214\",\"215\",\"216\",\"217\",\"218\",\"219\",\"220\",\"221\",\"222\",\"223\",\"224\",\"225\",\"226\",\"227\",\"228\",\"229\",\"230\",\"231\",\"232\",\"233\",\"234\",\"235\",\"236\",\"237\",\"238\",\"239\",\"240\",\"241\",\"242\",\"243\",\"244\",\"245\",\"246\",\"247\",\"248\",\"249\",\"250\",\"251\",\"252\",\"253\",\"254\",\"255\",\"256\",\"257\",\"258\",\"259\",\"260\",\"261\",\"262\",\"263\",\"264\",\"265\",\"266\",\"267\",\"268\",\"269\",\"270\",\"271\",\"272\",\"273\",\"274\",\"275\",\"276\",\"277\",\"278\",\"279\",\"280\",\"281\",\"282\",\"283\",\"284\",\"285\",\"286\",\"287\",\"288\",\"289\",\"290\",\"291\",\"292\",\"293\",\"294\",\"295\",\"296\",\"297\",\"298\",\"299\",\"300\",\"301\",\"302\",\"303\",\"304\",\"305\",\"306\",\"307\",\"308\",\"309\",\"310\",\"311\",\"312\",\"313\",\"314\",\"315\",\"316\",\"317\",\"318\",\"319\",\"320\",\"321\",\"322\",\"323\",\"324\",\"325\",\"326\",\"327\",\"328\",\"329\",\"330\",\"331\",\"332\",\"333\",\"334\",\"335\",\"336\",\"337\",\"338\",\"339\",\"340\",\"341\",\"342\",\"343\",\"344\",\"345\",\"346\",\"347\",\"348\",\"349\",\"350\",\"351\",\"352\",\"353\",\"354\",\"355\",\"356\",\"357\",\"358\",\"359\",\"360\",\"361\",\"362\",\"363\",\"364\",\"365\",\"366\",\"367\",\"368\",\"369\",\"370\",\"371\",\"372\",\"373\",\"374\",\"375\",\"376\",\"377\",\"378\",\"379\",\"380\",\"381\",\"382\",\"383\",\"384\",\"385\",\"386\",\"387\",\"388\",\"389\",\"390\",\"391\",\"392\",\"393\",\"394\",\"395\",\"396\",\"397\",\"398\",\"399\",\"400\",\"401\",\"402\",\"403\",\"404\",\"405\",\"406\",\"407\",\"408\",\"409\",\"410\",\"411\",\"412\",\"413\",\"414\",\"415\",\"416\",\"417\",\"418\",\"419\",\"420\",\"421\",\"422\",\"423\",\"424\",\"425\",\"426\",\"427\",\"428\",\"429\",\"430\",\"431\",\"432\",\"433\",\"434\",\"435\"],[\"Alice B.

It makes it pretty clear there are a few block. I'll also do a distance heat map below (which doesn't say the endorsement names, but shows similarity more clearly.)\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-cand-recs-uniq-count .cell tbl-cap='Unique options per race'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> President </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> US Senator </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> House CA-11 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> House CA-15 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> State Senate 11 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> State Assembly 17 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> State Assembly 19 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that races have one to four options among the endorsements made by these political organizations. This is different than the ballot measures (where options were Yes / No / NA). This increase in the number of levels of each factor can affect the clustering.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-cand-recs-na-count .cell tbl-cap='Races where one or more organizations did not endorse anyone (binary: Yes / No)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> President </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> US Senator </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> House CA-11 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> House CA-15 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> State Senate 11 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> State Assembly 17 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> State Assembly 19 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Yes </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAlso note that, in every race, there is one option that is the organization declining to endorse anyone. Thus, the number of _candidates_ endorsed is `n - 1` the value represented in the table.\n\nThis means that no organization made any endorsements for President. This fact is not true of any other race.\n\n### Nominal clustering\nVery tellingly, we see two broad clusters and two narrow clusters:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Political organization distance heat map\nI can also make a heat map of the clustering distance, or dissimilarity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_10_08-SF_political_support_clustering_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=720}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor the two large clusters in the dendrogram, this heat maps show two large squares of low-distance coloring (purple to dark blue) along the diagonal downward and to the right. These square blocks of proximity indicate clusters similarity among the organizations.\n\nClearly shown on this heatmap is how divergent the SF Young Republicans and the SF Republican Party are from any other organization analyzed. For example, the NOE Valley Democratic Club is closer (in clustering distance) to the SF Young Republicans and the SF Republican Party than the latter two are to each other.\n\n#### Political organization distance table (for candidate recs)\nUse the table below to filer, sort, and rank the clustering model's distance to make your own comparisons.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-org-cand-dis .cell tbl-cap='Table of unique political organization pairs, sorted by clustering proximity on endorsement'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-d9bfe0da426f3122e39c\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-d9bfe0da426f3122e39c\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"extensions\":[\"FixedColumns\",\"FixedHeader\"],\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",\"23\",\"24\",\"25\",\"26\",\"27\",\"28\",\"29\",\"30\",\"31\",\"32\",\"33\",\"34\",\"35\",\"36\",\"37\",\"38\",\"39\",\"40\",\"41\",\"42\",\"43\",\"44\",\"45\",\"46\",\"47\",\"48\",\"49\",\"50\",\"51\",\"52\",\"53\",\"54\",\"55\",\"56\",\"57\",\"58\",\"59\",\"60\",\"61\",\"62\",\"63\",\"64\",\"65\",\"66\",\"67\",\"68\",\"69\",\"70\",\"71\",\"72\",\"73\",\"74\",\"75\",\"76\",\"77\",\"78\",\"79\",\"80\",\"81\",\"82\",\"83\",\"84\",\"85\",\"86\",\"87\",\"88\",\"89\",\"90\",\"91\",\"92\",\"93\",\"94\",\"95\",\"96\",\"97\",\"98\",\"99\",\"100\",\"101\",\"102\",\"103\",\"104\",\"105\",\"106\",\"107\",\"108\",\"109\",\"110\",\"111\",\"112\",\"113\",\"114\",\"115\",\"116\",\"117\",\"118\",\"119\",\"120\",\"121\",\"122\",\"123\",\"124\",\"125\",\"126\",\"127\",\"128\",\"129\",\"130\",\"131\",\"132\",\"133\",\"134\",\"135\",\"136\",\"137\",\"138\",\"139\",\"140\",\"141\",\"142\",\"143\",\"144\",\"145\",\"146\",\"147\",\"148\",\"149\",\"150\",\"151\",\"152\",\"153\",\"154\",\"155\",\"156\",\"157\",\"158\",\"159\",\"160\",\"161\",\"162\",\"163\",\"164\",\"165\",\"166\",\"167\",\"168\",\"169\",\"170\",\"171\",\"172\",\"173\",\"174\",\"175\",\"176\",\"177\",\"178\",\"179\",\"180\",\"181\",\"182\",\"183\",\"184\",\"185\",\"186\",\"187\",\"188\",\"189\",\"190\",\"191\",\"192\",\"193\",\"194\",\"195\",\"196\",\"197\",\"198\",\"199\",\"200\",\"201\",\"202\",\"203\",\"204\",\"205\",\"206\",\"207\",\"208\",\"209\",\"210\",\"211\",\"212\",\"213\",\"214\",\"215\",\"216\",\"217\",\"218\",\"219\",\"220\",\"221\",\"222\",\"223\",\"224\",\"225\",\"226\",\"227\",\"228\",\"229\",\"230\",\"231\",\"232\",\"233\",\"234\",\"235\",\"236\",\"237\",\"238\",\"239\",\"240\",\"241\",\"242\",\"243\",\"244\",\"245\",\"246\",\"247\",\"248\",\"249\",\"250\",\"251\",\"252\",\"253\",\"254\",\"255\",\"256\",\"257\",\"258\",\"259\",\"260\",\"261\",\"262\",\"263\",\"264\",\"265\",\"266\",\"267\",\"268\",\"269\",\"270\",\"271\",\"272\",\"273\",\"274\",\"275\",\"276\",\"277\",\"278\",\"279\",\"280\",\"281\",\"282\",\"283\",\"284\",\"285\",\"286\",\"287\",\"288\",\"289\",\"290\",\"291\",\"292\",\"293\",\"294\",\"295\",\"296\",\"297\",\"298\",\"299\",\"300\",\"301\",\"302\",\"303\",\"304\",\"305\",\"306\",\"307\",\"308\",\"309\",\"310\",\"311\",\"312\",\"313\",\"314\",\"315\",\"316\",\"317\",\"318\",\"319\",\"320\",\"321\",\"322\",\"323\",\"324\",\"325\"],[\"Alice B.

Remarks on clustering by candidate endorsement\nThe race endorsements data set contains more options in general, allowing each organization for vary significantly in its character. We see this born out in the clustering dendrogram with more divergent clusters than seen in the ballot measure analysis.\n\nWhile the candidate endorsement clustering did not reveal any surprising similarities (in the opinion of yours truly), it did show how divergent the SF Republican Party and the SF Young Republicans are from the rest of the organizations, in terms of candidate endorsements.\n\n## Conclusions\nThe nominal clustering analysis worked well at identifying similar groups and quantifying relative similarity. **The ballot measure endorsement clustering was more revealing of the spectrum of relatedness of the political organizations** than the candidate clustering was. One weakness of this clustering analysis is that it weights all ballot measures and races as the same. For an individual voter, some topics and races may have more salience or effect, and this analysis cannot take that into account.\n\nBroadly, these results support the idea that an empirical approach can reveal more about the character of an organization than the words in its name, and that this analysis is useful for determining action-based political alignment.\n",
