    "text": "So why are we instinctively afraid of high-deductible plans?\nOver the years, we’ve been conditioned to think about healthcare in certain ways. For example, we think that Premiums work like: “you pay more for more doctor options”, or “deductible: smaller is better”. But we lose sight of our sunk costs, like premiums and taxes. FSA example: if you put $1,000 in an FSA, and lose $200 because you can’t spend it, that feels terrible and you are likely to put in less next year, because you’ve lost sight of what would have happened if that money were taxed— if your tax bracket is 30%, you are still $100 ahead!\nWe also tend to think in annual cycles for health care. But if there were the ability save or ‘carry over’ unspent dollars from year to year, that situation would open up to budgeting healthcare over multiple years. And one thing actuaries know about budgeting for unpredictable events with a high spread of potential costs: averaging over time makes the ending outcome more predictable. (See the central limit theorem).\nWhat we haven’t been conditioned to think about is: premiums as a function of deductibles; costs summed / averaged over multiple years; tax & retirement benefits of healthcare budgeting."

You are paying it with “house money,” and if you don’t spend all of that, you keep it.\nThe HSA is the very best supplemental retirement savings vehicle there is; in some ways, it’s even better than your 401K, which every financial planner tells you is the first thing you should max out.\nThe upper bound (out-of-pocket max) on HDHPs means the scenarios in which you could end up paying more than you would on a PPO or EPO/HMO are probably pretty narrow even in a single year, and across multiple years the risk is very low.\nHDHP plans are generally the same plan network as that insurer’s PPO or EPO/HMO. Everything about it is the same, except for how you pay for it. Your doctor doesn’t care. Switch, switch back, no issue."

    "text": "Introduction to self-hosted blogging\n\nWhich is really an introduction to the publishing ecosystem\nI have chosen to set up a self-hosted blog for many reasons. Self hosting has always seemed like the platonic ideal of a technically capable individual, and so I have set out to manifest this idea as a weekend project. As I will describe below, the default state of this is not ideal, and I’ve learned a lot about git, Github, Github Actions, Rmarkdown, Quarto, YAML, and TOML along the way.\nSelf hosting doesn’t literally mean I have set up a server in my office nook or anything so physically present. Self hosting just means I’m using my own html to render the content you see on the webpage before you. But why might that be worth it?\nThe state of online publishing today is a morass, to say the least. Some problems are quotidian, such as not being able to view a blog page without being bombarded with obnoxious popovers asking to log in, subscribe on the platform, or subscribe to the newsletter by email. Worse, the economics of certain high-profile blogging platforms recruiting writers to post their content there for a six-figure salary requires such platforms, in turn, to either monetize charge other, ‘lesser’ subscribers or readers. With leadership that doesn’t recognize how the mass-dissemination of hate speech can be a threat to democracy, platforms can accrue a hate speech problem, and be financially motivated to keep it.\nSelf-hosted blogging side-steps a lot of these problems. By self-hosting, I can craft a good web experience for the reader: no ads and no obnoxious popovers. I can post content without supporting these ethically dubious platforms with more content and more users (which would then be subjected to their recommendation algorithm). Should I devote the time, I could add an RSS feed, which is reminiscent of the time when all publications (aka blogs) were easily available and sync-able and readable as you wish: kind of like how podcasts still are today. (Can we make NetNewsWire relevant again?)\nPlus, Quarto and Hugo makes for a blazing fast-loading website. How cyber-punk is that?!"

    "section": "Why Quarto",
    "text": "Why Quarto\nWhy would I choose Quarto as the mechanism of munging my writing and coding into a website? Well, the question partly answers itself.\nI write tons of R markdown scripts already. R Markdown is a display wrapper language that allows for the execution of code in “chunks”. It makes for beautiful documents and reports where the code, figures/tables, and descriptions are fully self-contained for reproducible data analysis. The outputs can be useful and beautiful: as simple as a 1-page PDF, or as interactive as a Shiny web application.\nI already have my data-driven resume in R Markdown. So I have some experience manipulating the rendering code to make documents pretty and multi-output compatible (e.g. PDF, Github Markdown, html). And, in theory, these documents should be easily compatible when translated into a website / blog.\nI plan on posting lots of analysis and code, and the outputs. I have been, on occasion, posting these analyses to my github project repos, like for statistics, scRNA-seq, or bulk RNA-seq. Having a proper blog will be a great home to host all these posts together, and their future posts I can even tag them, so readers who are interested in one type can keep focused on posts of that topic.\nQuarto is the next generation of scientific publishing systems, following-up where R Markdown left off. Quarto natively renders to HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub (all by first passing through Pandoc, one of the most widely-supported markdown system). And Quarto natively supports running Python, R, Julia, and Observable JS code, because yes, contrary to popular belief, I can code in Python. (Also, I may mess around with Observable JS in the future; sounds nice for dashboards and interactive web data explorations.)"

    "text": "Deploying without weirdness (The road less trodden)\nBut, it turns out, Quarto’s own recommended implementation of a “Quarto Blog” involves some weird git and deploy mechanics. Quarto recommends either rendering the HTML locally and pushing it to git, using the quarto publish shell command, or setting up a GitHub action.\n\nThe “render HTML locally and push” option is not optimal, because it makes for a very large git repo with large changes for even small updates, all of which are generated programmatically from the Quarto code.\nThe quarto publish shell command creates a new branch of the repo to contain the HTML pages (still checking HTML into git), but this branch is never supposed to be merged with the main/HEAD branch. (Furthermore, it cannot be merged, because it is not descended from the main branch, and contains no copies of files in it main branch.)\nThe last option, which is Quarto’s recommended Github Action, still carries out code execution in the Action, requiring a fully copy of the R environment that solves for all possible code/projects run. I got many failures on installing reticulate to the docker image just so I could say print('Hello, world') using Python. Even more annoyingly, Rmarkdown was required to evaluate some code chunks. Both reticulate and Rmarkdown are notoriously difficult and long to install to a new environment.\n\nIan Taylor notes this in his blog post about GitHub actions. So, similarly to Ian, I added execute: freeze: auto lines to this blogs _quarto.yml so that 100% of Quarto would be pre-executed locally on my machine, and only if it changed. And those pre-rendered results are committed to git. Thus, this allows for the Github Action to be very sparse, only requiring an installation of Quarto on the shell PATH. From there, Quarto renders the HTML from the frozen quarto documents, and deploys it to Github Pages with an artifact transfer. The GitHub action takes ~ 45 seconds to deploy the page, and my locally run render takes less than 10 seconds. Nice!\n\nRolling your own\nI learned a lot from this adventure. From troubleshooting those malfunctioning Github Action deploys for so long, it really struck me that for this blog, as is so often the case in life, in the outdoors, and in data science, the road less traveled is sometimes a road more suitable. And with good documentation, it’s not too bad to implement.\n\nprint(\"Hello, world\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, world\"\n\n\n\nprint('Hello, world')\n\nHello, world"
