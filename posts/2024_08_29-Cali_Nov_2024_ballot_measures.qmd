## Introduction
San Francisco has a big ballot incoming to voters this November, with 25 total ballot measures for voters to decide upon before--or on--election day (10 state measures, and 15 city / county measures of San Francisco). This is less than other *very lengthy* ballots previously sent to voters [@sfvote1993], but still longer than many in recent memory.

Below, I have collated the ballot measure numbers (or letters), titles, descriptions, and some context (in some cases, where available.)

## State-wide ballot measures
```{r}
state_measures <- read_csv(path(og_data_path, "state_ballot_measures.csv"),
                           show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  rename("Notes" = "Description")
state_meta <- read_csv(path(og_data_path, "Ballotpedia_state_ballot_measures.csv"),
                       show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r}
unified_state <- state_meta %>%
  #select(Title, Type) %>%
  left_join(state_measures, by = "Title") %>%
  mutate(prop_number = as.integer(str_extract(Title, "(?<=Proposition\\s)\\d{1,2}"))) %>%
  arrange(prop_number) %>%
  select(!prop_number) %>%
  relocate(Title) %>%
  relocate(Name, .after = Title)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-state-props
#| tbl-cap: "Table of statewide ballot propositions"

unified_state %>%
  kable(format = "html", escape = FALSE)
```
Type is the category of ballot measure from Ballotpedia: BI = [Bond issue](https://ballotpedia.org/Bond_issue); CISS = [Initiated state statute](https://ballotpedia.org/Initiated_state_statute); LRCA = [Legislatively referred constitutional amendment](https://ballotpedia.org/Legislatively_referred_constitutional_amendment) [@BP2024] Notes are from [@Calmatters2024].

## San Francisco ballot measures
```{r}
#| label: tbl-sf-props
#| tbl-cap: "Table of San Francisco ballot propositions"
#| 
sf_measures <- read_csv(path(og_data_path, "SF_county_measures.csv"),
                        show_col_types = FALSE)

sf_meas_desc <- read_csv(path(og_data_path, "sf_ballot_meas_2024_desc.csv"),
                         show_col_types = FALSE)

sf_measures %>%
  left_join(sf_meas_desc, by = "Title") %>%
  kable(type = "html", escape = FALSE)
```
